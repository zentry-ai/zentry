You can try the [Zentry Demo](https://Zentry-4vmi.vercel.app) live here.

## Overview

The Personalized AI Companion leverages Zentry to retain information across interactions, enabling a tailored learning experience. It creates memories for each user interaction and integrates with OpenAI's GPT models to provide detailed and context-aware responses to user queries.

## Setup

Before you begin, follow these steps to set up the demo application:

1. Clone the Zentry repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zentryai/Zentry.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the demo application folder:
   ```bash
   cd Zentry/examples/Zentry-demo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   Zentry_API_KEY=your_Zentry_api_key
   ```
   You can obtain your `Zentry_API_KEY` by signing up at [Zentry API Dashboard](https://app.zentry.gg/dashboard/api-keys).

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Enhancing the Next.js Application

Once the demo is running, you can customize and enhance the Next.js application by modifying the components in the `Zentry-demo` folder. Consider:
- Adding new memory features to improve contextual retention.
- Customizing the UI to better suit your application needs.
- Integrating additional APIs or third-party services to extend functionality.
